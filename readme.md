# Use of Pre-train neural network

## introduction:
use pre-trained resnet18 models to classify between the negative and positive samples; you will be provided with the dataset object. The particular pre-trained model will be resnet18; you will have three questions:

- [x] change the output layer
- [x] train the model
- [x] identify several misclassified samples
